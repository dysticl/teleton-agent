# MEMORY.md - Your Long-Term Memory

_This file is your persistent memory. Only update it when you learn something genuinely important._
_Keep it under ~100 lines. Only the first 150 lines are loaded at startup — anything beyond is invisible to you. When it grows large, consolidate related entries, remove outdated info, or move details to daily logs._
